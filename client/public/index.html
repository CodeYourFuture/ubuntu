        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Ubuntu Women Shelter is the first dedicated shelter in the UK that provides
          short
          term accomodation for women with no recourse to public funds. We are also the first night shelter run and
          managed
          only by people with direct experience of the asylum, immigration system and destitution.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are located in Glasgow and between us  have more than 10 years of shared
          experience supporting undocumented women.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ubuntu</strong> is defined by our <em>no borders</em> ethos and we see
          the
          shelter as active ongoing resistance to the dehumanising and brutalising effects of borders.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ubuntu is designed to meet the unique and pressing needs of women who excluded
          from
          accessing homelessness and welfare services and housing. These include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: justify;">non-EEA women with limited leave to remain (students, asylum seekers pending
            a
            final resolution of their claims);</li>
          <li style="text-align: justify;"> women who have status but face delays in accessing benefits;</li>
          <li style="text-align: justify;">citizens and women with leave to remain but no access to housing benefits
            and
            welfare.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We welcome all women (cis and trans) and non-binary folks, including
          sex-workers.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are open to all faiths and religious persuations.</p>
